Paths.js
========

Paths.js is a library to generate [SVG paths](http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/paths.html), allowing you to create your own charts using a functional and testable API. It provides the primitives to create various shapes and charts starting from raw data, but it does not prescribe how you render these charts. This means you can use Paths.js to build components for your favorite frontend framework, and works even server-side on [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/).

Paths.js offers three APIs, of increasing abstraction. The lowest level is a chainable API to generate an arbitrary SVG path. On top of this, paths for simple geometric shapes such as polygons or circle sectors are defined. At the highest level, there is an API to generate some simple graphs (pie, line chart, radar...) for a collection of data, assembling the simple shapes.

Let me see it
-------------

Of course, when judging a chart library, this is a very reasonable request. But Paths.js is different: it provides the components, and you draw the charts. That said, there is a [demo application](http://andreaferretti.github.io/paths-js-demo/) to show some features - [here](https://github.com/andreaferretti/paths-js-demo) you find the source.

Philosophy
----------

Drawing beautiful charts is a craft, and often one needs to add custom interactions, styling or animations. There are some beautiful chart libraries out there, such as [Flotcharts](http://www.flotcharts.org/) or [Dimple](http://dimplejs.org/), and if those are enough for your needs, they can be a pleasure to use.

In many cases, though, what I really wanted was a library to take care of the generation of the chart, while still leaving me the possibility to render the actual thing. Paths.s does exactly this. It eventually generates [SVG paths](http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/paths.html) with a high level API. These paths can be then used together with a template engine such as [Mustache](http://mustache.github.io/) or [Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com/) to display SVG graphics in the browser. If instead of a static template engine, you use a data binding library, such as [Facebook React](http://facebook.github.io/react/), [Ractive.js](http://www.ractivejs.org/) or [Angular](http://angularjs.org/), you get animated graphics for free.

In designing Paths.js, I have tried to follow a few principles:

* paths should be immutable
* all exposed methods should be pure
* from this follows that it is trivial to test components
* and that they work on Node.js as well
* it should be easy to integrate Paths.js into various frameworks

For a more detailed exposition of the philosophy behind Paths.js, see [this blog post](http://mlarocca.github.io/01-22-2014/pathsjs_ractive.html) by Marcello La Rocca. Also, check the slides from [my talk at MilanoJS user group](https://github.com/andreaferretti/paths-talk-slides), together with the [examples](https://github.com/andreaferretti/paths-talk-examples).

Another [presentation](http://mlarocca.github.io/graphicalweb2014/) by Marcello goes in detail over the state of graphics in the browser, covering various approaches, including Paths.js.

Documentation

A detailed documentation is available on the [wiki](). Here are links to the main entry points.

Browser support
---------------

Paths.js works in any environment that supports a modern version of Javascript, namely ES5. This includes any version of Node.js and all recent browsers. If you need support for older browsers, you can include an [ES5 polyfill](https://github.com/kriskowal/es5-shim/).

On the other hand, not every browser will be able to display the SVG graphics that you will generate. Usually, recent desktop browsers are ok, but mobile browser are slow in adopting the SVG specification. You can refer to [caniuse](http://caniuse.com/#search=svg) for more detailed information.

Using Paths.js with the Canvas API
----------------------------------

Paths.js does not directly support the [canvas element](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canvas_element), essentially because there is no need to do so. The [canvg](https://github.com/gabelerner/canvg) project allows to draw SVG paths on a `<canvas>` element, and it seems that canvas [will be able](http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-whatwg-archive/2012Mar/0269.html) to support SVG paths natively. Of course, canvas-based solutions limit the possibilities offered by data binding libraries for interaction, but they could be used as a fallback on less recent browsers.
